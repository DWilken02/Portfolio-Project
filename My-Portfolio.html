            <p>Hi my name is Dylan Wilken. In this section I will tell you a little bit about myself. I went to <a href="https://www.hsd.k12.or.us/imlay">Imlay Elementary School</a> for about 7 years(k-6). I then went to private school at <a href="https://www.cordeoacademy.org/">Cor Deo christian academy</a> during middle school for 2 1/2 years before switching to online school for the remainder of my school years. In my Junior and Senior years I took some classes at HilHi (<a href="https://www.hsd.k12.or.us/hilhi">Hillsboro High School</a>) as well as doing online school. I then graduated from High School in 2018 and went to take a semester of college at <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/">PCC</a>.</p>
