            <p>Hi my name is Dylan Wilken. In this section I will tell you a little bit about myself. I went to Imlay Elementary School for about 7 years(k-6). I then went to private school at Cor deo christian academy during middle school for 2 1/2 years before switching to online school for the remainder of my school years. In my Junior and Senior years I took some classes at HilHi (Hillsboro High School) as well as doing online school. I then graduated from High School in 2018 and went to take a semester of college at PCC.</p>
